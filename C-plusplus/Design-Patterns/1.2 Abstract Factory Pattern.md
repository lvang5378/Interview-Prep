##Abstract Factory - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

###Eaxmple: To creat a scroll bar
```c++
ScrollBar *sb = new MacScrollBar;   //not good in real world 
//instead, what we should do is somthing like:
ScrollBar *sb = guiFactory->createScrollBar();
```
**Because guiFactory is an instance of MacFactory class, the createScrollBar returns a new instance of Mac style scrollbar. The MacFactory itself is a subclass of GUIFactory which is an abstract class where general interface for widgets.**    
So, the product objects here, are widgets.   
The instance variable guiFactory is initialized as:  
```c++
GUIFactory *guiFactory = new MacFactory; 
```

##Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>

class Button
{
public:
	virtual void paint() = 0;
};
 
class WinButton : public Button 
{
public:
	void paint (){
		std::cout << " Window Button \n";
       }
};
 
class MacButton : public Button 
{
public:
	void paint (){
		std::cout << " Mac Button \n";
       }
};

class ScrollBar 
{
public:
	virtual void paint() = 0;
};
 
class WinScrollBar : public ScrollBar 
{
public:
	void paint (){
		std::cout << " Window ScrollBar \n";
       }
};
 
class MacScrollBar : public ScrollBar {
public:

	void paint (){
		std::cout << " Mac ScrollBar \n";
       }
};


class GUIFactory 
{
public:
	virtual Button* createButton () = 0;
	virtual ScrollBar* createScrollBar () = 0;
};
 
class WinFactory : public GUIFactory 
{
public:
	Button* createButton (){
		return new WinButton;
	}
	ScrollBar* createScrollBar (){
		return new WinScrollBar;
	}
};
 
class MacFactory : public GUIFactory 
{
public:
	Button* createButton (){
		return new MacButton;
	}
	ScrollBar* createScrollBar (){
		return new MacScrollBar;
	}
};
 
int main()
{
	GUIFactory* guiFactory;
	Button *btn;
	ScrollBar *sb;

	guiFactory = new MacFactory;
	btn = guiFactory->createButton();
	btn -> paint();
	sb = guiFactory->createScrollBar();
	sb -> paint();

	guiFactory = new WinFactory;
	btn = guiFactory->createButton();
	btn -> paint();
	sb = guiFactory->createScrollBar();
	sb -> paint();

	return 0;
}
```

####All this is possible because MacFactory is a subclass of GUIFactory, an abstract class that defines a general interface of creating widgets. It includes operations like createScrollBar and createButton for instantiating different kinds of widgets:
```c++
class GUIFactory 
{
public:
	virtual Button* createButton () = 0;
	virtual ScrollBar* createScrollBar () = 0;
};
```


##Abstract Factory Pattern vs Factory Method
What's the difference between Abstract Factory Pattern and Factory Method?  
    
    1. Abstract Factory design pattern creates Factory.
    2. Factory design pattern creates Products.
