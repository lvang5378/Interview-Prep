##Abstract Factory - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

###Eaxmple: To creat a scroll bar
```c++
ScrollBar *sb = new MacScrollBar;   //not good in real world 
//instead, what we should do is somthing like:
ScrollBar *sb = guiFactory->createScrollBar();
```
Because guiFactory is an instance of MacFactory class, the createScrollBar returns a new instance of Mac style scrollbar. The MacFactory itself is a subclass of GUIFactory which is an abstract class where general interface for widgets.  
So, the product objects here, are widgets.   
The instance variable guiFactory is initialized as:  
```c++
GUIFactory *guiFactory = new MacFactory; 
```
