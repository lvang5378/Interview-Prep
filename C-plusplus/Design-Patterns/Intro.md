#Design Patterns
In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

###Goal: 
•	Understand the problem and matching it with some pattern.
•	Reusage of old interface or making the present design reusable for the future usage.

 

1. creational design patterns
  - abstract factory
  - builder
  - factory method
  - object pool
  - prototype
  - singleton
2. structural design patterns
  - adapter
  - bridge
  - composite
  - decoder
  - facade
  - flyweight
  - private class data
  - proxy
3. behavioral design patterns
  - Chain of responsibility:  
  A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
  - Command:  
  Encapsulate a command request as an object
  - Interpreter:  
  A way to include language elements in a program
  - Iterato:r  
  Sequentially access the elements of a collection
  - Mediato:r  
  Defines simplified communication between classes
  - Memento:  
  Capture and restore an object's internal state
  - Null Object:  
  Designed to act as a default value of an object
  - Observe:r  
  A way of notifying change to a number of classes
  - State:  
  Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
  - Strategy:  
  Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
  - Template method:  
  Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
  - Visitor:  
  Defines a new operation to a class without change
