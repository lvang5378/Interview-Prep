##124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum My Submissions Question

> Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

> For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

> For example:
> Given the below binary tree,
> 
       1
      / \
     2   3
> Return 6.

###Other's code:
ã€‹ update the val of each node of the tree bottom-up, the new val of TreeNode *x stands for the max sum started from any node in subtree x and ended in x, mataining the re for result in traversal at the same time.

    class Solution {
        int maxToRoot(TreeNode *root, int &re) {
            if (!root) return 0;
            int l = maxToRoot(root->left, re);
            int r = maxToRoot(root->right, re);
            if (l < 0) l = 0;
            if (r < 0) r = 0;
            if (l + r + root->val > re) re = l + r + root->val;
            return root->val += max(l, r);
        }
        public:
        int maxPathSum(TreeNode *root) {
            int max = -2147483648;
            maxToRoot(root, max);
            return max;
        }
    };
