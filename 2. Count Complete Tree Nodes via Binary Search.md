##222. Count Complete Tree Nodes My Submissions Question

> Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

> In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

---
###Code:
count node <b> recursively </b>, 
  - if depth of left== depth of right, return power(2, depth)-1;
  - else return (1 + rec(root->left) + rec(root->right))   <b> -*important*- </b>  
Code starts here:  

    class Solution {
    public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {

        if(!root) return 0;

        int hl=0, hr=0;

        TreeNode *l=root, *r=root;

        while(l) {hl++;l=l->left;}

        while(r) {hr++;r=r->right;}

        if(hl==hr) return pow(2,hl)-1;

        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);   

    }

    };
