##Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm

> In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.  (from Wiki)

####A string matching algorithm wants to find the starting index m in string S[] that matches the search word W[].

> ##Description of pseudocode for the search algorithm
> The above example contains all the elements of the algorithm. For the moment, we assume the existence of a "partial match" table T, described below, which indicates where we need to look for the start of a new match in the event that the current one ends in a mismatch. The entries of T are constructed so that if we have a match starting at S[m] that fails when comparing S[m + i] to W[i], then the next possible match will start at index m + i - T[i] in S (that is, T[i] is the amount of "backtracking" we need to do after a mismatch). This has two implications: first, T[0] = -1, which indicates that if W[0] is a mismatch, we cannot backtrack and must simply check the next character; and second, although the next possible match will begin at index m + i - T[i], as in the example above, we need not actually check any of the T[i] characters after that, so that we continue searching from W[T[i]]. The following is a sample pseudocode implementation of the KMP search algorithm.
>   algorithm kmp_search:

```
    input:
        an array of characters, S (the text to be searched)
        an array of characters, W (the word sought)
    output:
        an integer (the zero-based position in S at which W is found)

    define variables:
        an integer, m ← 0 (the beginning of the current match in S)
        an integer, i ← 0 (the position of the current character in W)
        an array of integers, T (the table, computed elsewhere)

    while m + i < length(S) do
        if W[i] = S[m + i] then
            if i = length(W) - 1 then
                return m                  //here return the result
            let i = i + 1
        else
            if T[i] > -1 then
                let m = m + i - T[i], i = T[i]
            else
                let i = 0, m = m + 1
            
    (if we reach here, we have searched all of S unsuccessfully)
    return the length of S

```

###Code:
```C
void KMPSearch(char *pat, char *txt)
{
    int M = strlen(pat);
    int N = strlen(txt);
    
    // Here name lps indicates longest proper prefix which is also suffix
    // create lps[] that will hold the longest prefix suffix
    // values for pattern
    int *lps = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*M);
    int j  = 0;  // index for pat[]
 
    // Preprocess the pattern (calculate lps[] array)
    computeLPSArray(pat, M, lps);
 
    int i = 0;  // index for txt[]
    while (i < N)
    {
      if (pat[j] == txt[i])
      {
        j++;
        i++;
      }
 
      if (j == M)
      {
        printf("Found pattern at index %d \n", i-j);
        j = lps[j-1];
      }
 
      // mismatch after j matches
      else if (i < N && pat[j] != txt[i])
      {
        // Do not match lps[0..lps[j-1]] characters,
        // they will match anyway
        if (j != 0)
         j = lps[j-1];
        else
         i = i+1;
      }
    }
    free(lps); // to avoid memory leak
}

void computeLPSArray(char *pat, int M, int *lps)
{
    int len = 0;  // length of the previous longest prefix suffix
    int i;
 
    lps[0] = 0; // lps[0] is always 0
    i = 1;
 
    // the loop calculates lps[i] for i = 1 to M-1
    while (i < M)
    {
       if (pat[i] == pat[len])
       {
         len++;
         lps[i] = len;
         i++;
       }
       else // (pat[i] != pat[len])
       {
         if (len != 0)
         {
           // This is tricky. Consider the example 
           // AAACAAAA and i = 7.
           len = lps[len-1];
 
           // Also, note that we do not increment i here
         }
         else // if (len == 0)
         {
           lps[i] = 0;
           i++;
         }
       }
    }
}
```

        Examples:  
        For the pattern “AABAACAABAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
        For the pattern “ABCDE”, lps[] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        For the pattern “AAAAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        For the pattern “AAABAAA”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]
        For the pattern “AAACAAAAAC”, lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

Searching Algorithm:  
Unlike the Naive algo where we slide the pattern by one, we use a value from lps[] to decide the next sliding position. Let us see how we do that. When we compare pat[j] with txt[i] and see a mismatch, we know that characters pat[0..j-1] match with txt[i-j+1…i-1], and we also know that lps[j-1] characters of pat[0…j-1] are both proper prefix and suffix which means we do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j…i-1] because we know that these characters will anyway match. See KMPSearch() in the below code for details.

Preprocessing Algorithm:  
In the preprocessing part, we calculate values in lps[]. To do that, we keep track of the length of the longest prefix suffix value (we use len variable for this purpose) for the previous index. We initialize lps[0] and len as 0. If pat[len] and pat[i] match, we increment len by 1 and assign the incremented value to lps[i]. If pat[i] and pat[len] do not match and len is not 0, we update len to lps[len-1]. See computeLPSArray () in the below code for details.
