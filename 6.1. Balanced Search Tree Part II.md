##Balanced Search Trees
    Idea: ensure that height always O(logn) [best possible]  
    => Search / insert / delete/min/max/pred/succ will then run in O(log) time [n = #of keys in tree]
    Example: red-black trees   
    [see also AVL trees, splaytrees, B trees]

####Red-Black Invariants
    1. each node red or black 
    2. root is always black 
    3. no 2 reds in a row
      [red node => only black children]
    4. every root-NULL path has same number of black nodes  (like in an unsuccessful search)

####Height Guarantee
  * Claim: every red-black tree with n nodes has height <= 2Log(n+1)
  * Proof: observation: if every root-null path has >= k nodes, then tree includes (at the top) a perfectly balanced search tree of depth k-1
  * Story so far: size n >= 2^k-1, where k= min # of nodes on root-NULL path => k<=log(n+1) 
  * Thus: in a red -black tree with n nodes, there is a root-null path with at most log(n+1) black nodes
  * By 4th Invariant: every roor-null path has <=log(n+1) black nodes
  * By 3rd Invariant: every root-NULL path has <=2log(n+1) total nodes
