## 238. Product of Array Except Self 
> Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

> Solve it without division and in O(n).

> For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

> Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

####Basically the idea is:
        one number (fromBegin) calculate the number *= from begin to the end   
        one number (fromEnd) calculate the number *= from end to the begin  
        at each point the result is fromBegin[i]*fromEnd[n-1-i] !!!!!!!!!!  
        
        at i=0 res[i] = 1; res[i]*= fromBegin =1; 
        then at the end of the for loop res[n-1-i] *= fromLast, fromLast here is the product of n-1 to 1

###First, consider O(n) time and O(n) space solution.
 ```c++  
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
            int n=nums.size();
            vector<int> fromBegin(n);
            fromBegin[0]=1;
            vector<int> fromLast(n);
            fromLast[0]=1;
    
            for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
                fromBegin[i]=fromBegin[i-1]*nums[i-1];
                fromLast[i]=fromLast[i-1]*nums[n-i];
            }
    
            vector<int> res(n);
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                res[i]=fromBegin[i]*fromLast[n-1-i];
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```

###We just need to change the two vectors to two integers and note that we should do multiplying operations for two related elements of the results vector in each loop.
```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
            int n=nums.size();
            int fromBegin=1;
            int fromLast=1;
            vector<int> res(n,1);
    
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                res[i]*=fromBegin;
                fromBegin*=nums[i];
                res[n-1-i]*=fromLast;
                fromLast*=nums[n-1-i];
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    
```
