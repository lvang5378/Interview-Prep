###Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

    void addWord(word)
    bool search(word)
     
search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string   
containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.

For example:

    addWord("bad")
    addWord("dad")
    addWord("mad")
    search("pad") -> false
    search("bad") -> true
    search(".ad") -> true
    search("b..") -> true

---
My Thought:
        similar with search in Trie   
        - if there is a '.' in the word, for example ".dd", then we need to try all the possibilities from 'add', 'bdd', to 'zdd'   
        or is there a better way?    
        - Doesn't seem like there is a better solution
