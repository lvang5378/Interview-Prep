##Balanced Search Tree

###Operations and Applications: 

| Operations  |    Running time （Array） | Binary Search Tree|
| ---  |    :---: | :---: |
| Search   |    O(logn) |  O(logn) |  
| Select (given order statistic)   |   O(1)  |O(logn) |  
| MIN/MIX  |    O(1) |O(logn) |  
| Pred/Succ (given pointer to a key) |    O(1) |O(logn) |  
| Rank (i.e # of keys less than or equal to a given value) |    O(logn) |O(logn) |  
| Output in Sorted Order  |    O(n) |  O(n) |  
| ---  |    --- | --- |
| Insertion ***  |    O(n)  |   O(logn) | 
| Deletion ***   |    O(n)  |  O(logn) | 

#### Binary Search Tree: like sorted array + faster (logarithmic) inserts + deletes !!!
    **It is like a dynamic version of a sorted array.**
##### If you just need Insertion, deletion and keep track of either MIN or MAX, you can also use heap. 
##### If you just need Search, Insertion and Deletion, they are also supported by hash tables.

### Binary Search Tree Structure
- exactly one node per key
- most basic version:
   - each node has:
      - left child poiter
      - right child pointer
      - parent pointer

###Search Tree Property:  
      - every node in the left sub-tree should be less than the node
      - every node in the right sub-tree should be greater than the node
      - how to handle tie..

##The Height of a BST
####Note:  
      - many possible trees for a set of keys 
      - height coule be anywhere from logn to n;
      - logn is the best case, perfectly balanced
      - n is worst case, a chain

###Searching and Inserting
####To Seach for key k in tree T
      -  start at the root
      -  traverse left/right child pointers as needed   left when k< key t current node; right when k>key at current node
      -  return node with key K or NULL as appropriate

#### To Insert a new key k into a tree T
      - search for k (unsuccessfully)
      - rewire final NULL ptr to point to new node with key K

####Pred
To compute the predecessor of key k  

      - easy case: if k's left subtree nonempty, return max key in left subtree;  
      - otherwise: follow parent pointers until you get to a key less than k. **************

###In-order Traversal 
To print out keys in increasing order    

      - let r=root of search tree with subtrees T_l and T_r  
      - recurse on T_l, [ by recursion/induction, prints out keys of T_l in increasing order  
      - print out r's key  
      - recurse on T_r [prints our keys of T_r in increasing order]  

Running time: O(n) [O(1) time, n recursive calls ] 

###Deletion:
To delete a key k from a search tree
      - seach for k
      east case: k's nodes has no children
      - just delete k's node from tree node
      moduum case (k's node has one child
      - just "splite out" k's node (unique child assure position previously held by k's node)
      difficult case: (k's node has 2 children)
      - compute k's predecessor l (easy case of predessecor)
      [i. e. tracerse k's (non-null ) left child ptr, then right child ptrs until no longer possible]
      - swap k and l !!! ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊
      Note: in its new position, k has no right child!!
      => easy to delete or splice out k's new node
      Exercise: at end, have a valid seach tree

Runtime O(height) same as predessecor

### Select and Rank
Idea: store a little bit of extra info at each tree node about the tree itself (i.r. not about the data)  *************
Example augmentation: size(x) = # of treenodes in subtree rooted at x  
Node: if x has children y and z, then size(y) + size(z) +1   
Also: easy to keep sizes up-to-date duting an insertion or deletion

How to selest ith order statistic from augmented search tree (with subtree sizes)
      - start at root x with chilren y and z
      - let a = size(y) [a=0 if x has no left child]
      - if a=i-1 return x's key
         ith order statistic of search tree rated at y
      - if a<i-1 recursively compute (i0a01)th orde statistic of search tree rated at z

Runtime: O(height)
