##Balanced Search Tree

###Operations and Applications: 

| Operations  |    Running time （Array） | Binary Search Tree|
| ---  |    :---: | :---: |
| Search   |    O(logn) |  O(logn) |  
| Select (given order statistic)   |   O(1)  |O(logn) |  
| MIN/MIX  |    O(1) |O(logn) |  
| Pred/Succ (given pointer to a key) |    O(1) |O(logn) |  
| Rank (i.e # of keys less than or equal to a given value) |    O(logn) |O(logn) |  
| Output in Sorted Order  |    O(n) |  O(n) |  
| ---  |    --- | --- |
| Insertion ***  |    O(n)  |   O(logn) | 
| Deletion ***   |    O(n)  |  O(logn) | 

#### Binary Search Tree: like sorted array + faster (logarithmic) inserts + deletes !!!
    **It is like a dynamic version of a sorted array.**
##### If you just need Insertion, deletion and keep track of either MIN or MAX, you can also use heap. 
##### If you just need Search, Insertion and Deletion, they are also supported by hash tables.
