## Word Search II

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

For example,
Given words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =

    [
      ['o','a','a','n'],
      ['e','t','a','e'],
      ['i','h','k','r'],
      ['i','f','l','v']
    ]
Return ["eat","oath"].
####Note:
    You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.

####Hint:
- You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?
- <b>If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. 
What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? 
Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, 
please work on this problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) first.</b>

####Expain:
        What they don't want is 
            for(string word: words)
                do checkWord(vector<vector<char>> & board, string word){}
        What they want is to store all the words in a trie tree, 
        For those letters in the board that doesn't exists in any words (trie tree), 
        we do not need to go through them again in each word

>####By other
> The idea is to use a Trie to build a prefix tree for words to simplify the search and do DFS to search all the possible strings. For Trie, 26 pointers to point the sub-strings and a bool leaf to indicate whether the current node is a leaf (i.e. a string in words) and also idx is used to save the index of words for the current node. For DFS, just check if the current position is visited before (board[i][j]=='X'), if so, return, check if there is a string with such prefix (nullptr == root->children[words[idx][pos]-'a']), if not, return; otherwise, check if the current searched string is a leaf of the trie (a string in words), if so, save it to res and set leaf of the trie node to false to indicate such string is already found. At last, move to its neighbors to continue the search. Remember to recover the char [i][j] at the end.
