##235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree 
 > Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

> According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”  

###Notice
  <b> I got this question completely wrong  
  1. I forgot to take advatange of the `characteristic of BST`
  and DFS all the nodes to find p & q this is the first mistake.  
  2.  Also, I forgot that the the `lowest common ancestor of p and q are the depth TreeNode from where we can find both p and q node`
  so we don't need to backtracking all the way to the root, just return the depth node we found that are ancestor of both p and q. 
  Return the first node that is ancestor of both p & q, then stop!
