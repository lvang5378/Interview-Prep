##21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
###FB interview

> Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

---
###Idea is very straight-foward, one pointer in list_1, one pointer in list_2, important to store the new head of the new list, and return 

###Code:
    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode *mergeTwoLists(ListNode *l1, ListNode *l2) {  
               ListNode* head = new ListNode(-1);  
              ListNode* p = head;  
                while(l1!=NULL || l2!= NULL)  
                {  
                     int val1 = l1==NULL?INT_MAX:l1->val;  
                     int val2 = l2==NULL? INT_MAX:l2->val;  
                     if(val1<=val2)  
                     {  
                          p->next = l1;          
                          l1=l1->next;  
                     }  
                     else  
                     {  
                          p->next = l2;  
                          l2 = l2->next;  
                     }  
                     p= p->next;  
                }  
                p = head->next;  
                delete head;  
                return p;  
           } 
    };
