##98. Validate Binary Search Tree 
Check is a BT is a BST.
> Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

> Assume a BST is defined as follows:

> The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.

Think on case:   

    Input: [10,5,15,null,null,6,20]  
    Output should be false!!!
    
So we need to record previous node.

###Other's code:

    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* prev = NULL;
        return validate(root, prev);
    }
    bool validate(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* &prev) {
        if (node == NULL) return true;
        if (!validate(node->left, prev)) return false;
        if (prev != NULL && prev->val >= node->val) return false;
        prev = node;
        return validate(node->right, prev);
    }
