#### Computing strong components via DFS
####Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
Formal definition: the SCC of a directed graph G are the equivalence classes of the relation u~v <=> exists path u->v and a path v->u
~ is an equivalence realtion

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm#The_algorithm  
- code on Geeks for Geeks: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/


#####Theorem: can compute in SCCs in O(m+n） time
#####Algorithm: (given directed graph G)
1. Let G_rev = G with all arcs reversed
2. run DFS-Loop on G_rev         //goal: computer "magical ordering" of nodes   
       - Let f(v) = " finishing time" of each vertex v in　V
3. run DFS-Loop on G              //goal: discover the SCCs one-by-one  
        - **Processing nodes in decreasing order of finishing time**     
        - relabel the node to their finishing time, and process in decreasing order (how to put the node in descending order?                     don't use sort, that will take O(nlogn) time, instead, remember their order in the first pass)  
        - [SCCs = nodes with the same "leader"]

DFS-Loop(graph G)
global variable t=0
[# of nodes prcessed so far] //for finishing times in 1st pass
global variable s-NULL
[current source vertex]  //for leaders in 2nd pass
- Assume nodes labelled 1 to n
- For i=n downto 1
  - if i not yet explored
      - S:=i
      - DFS(G, i)
      
---      
DFS(graph G, node i)
- mark i as explored ( for rest of DFS-Loop)
- set leader(i):= node s
- for each arc (i, j) in G:
  - if j not yet explored:
      - DFS(G, j)
- t++
- set f(i):=t //i's finishing time


#####RUNNING TIME: 2*DFS = O(m+n)

### The Analysis   
####Observation
#####Claim:
The SCCs of a directed graph induced in an acycloc "meta-graph"
- meta-nodes = the SCCs            all SCCs are seens as meta-node,  c1, c2, c3, ...ck of G    
- exists arc c1 -> c2 <=> exists arc (i, j) in G with i in c1, j in c2  

#####Why acyclic?: 
    A cycle of SCCs would collapse into one

#####How are the SCC of the original G and its reverse G_rev related?
    SCCs in G and G_rev are exactly the same, just labelling the nodes differently.

####Key Lemma
#####Lemma:
    consider two "adjacent SCCs in G:  
    c1 -> c2
    Let f(v) = finishing times of DFS-Loop in G  
#####Then: max{f(c1)} < max{f(c2)}  

#####Corollary: maximum f-value of G must lie in a "sink SCC".   
     In G_rev: c1 -> c2 -> c3   then f1 < f2 < f3


#####Correctness Intuition
    By Corollary : 2nd pass of DFS-Loop begins somewhere in a sink SCC C*  
    =>  *** first call to DFS discovers C* and nothing else ***    
    => rest of DFS-Loop like recursing on G with c* deleted  [starts in a sink node of G-c*]  
    => successive calls to DFS(G, i) " peel off the SCCs one by one [in reverse topological order of the meta-graph of SCCs]

###Has to use DFS because:
    In the fist pass, for node v, you have to find every node that finishes exploring first 
    before finally back-tracking all the way back to v, and deeming v fully explored. 
    And it was only at that point that v got its finishing time after everthing reachable
    from it had gotten there lower finishing times.



###Class of the code on geeks for geeks.
```c++
class Graph
{
    int V;    // No. of vertices
    list<int> *adj;    // An array of adjacency lists
 
    // Fills Stack with vertices (in increasing order of finishing
    // times). The top element of stack has the maximum finishing 
    // time
    void fillOrder(int v, bool visited[], stack<int> &Stack);
 
    // A recursive function to print DFS starting from v
    void DFSUtil(int v, bool visited[]);
public:
    Graph(int V);
    void addEdge(int v, int w);
 
    // The main function that finds and prints strongly connected
    // components
    void printSCCs();
 
    // Function that returns reverse (or transpose) of this graph
    Graph getTranspose();
};
```
