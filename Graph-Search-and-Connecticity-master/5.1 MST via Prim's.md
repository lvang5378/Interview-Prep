##Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Greedy Algorithm  

The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST.  

##Algorithm
```
1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.
2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. 
    Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first.
3) While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices
….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.
….b) Include u to mstSet.
….c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, 
      iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, 
      if weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, 
      update the key value as weight of u-v
```

##Complexity
**Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2)**. If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity of Prim’s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap. Please see Prim’s MST for Adjacency List Representation for more details.
