it does works  for negative weight, but there should be no negative cycles.  
it can be used to detacting negative weight cycle

##Algorithm
For each of these pairs of vertices, the true shortest path could be either

    (1) a path that only uses vertices in the set {1, ..., k}
or

    (2) a path that goes from i to k + 1 and then from k + 1 to j.
We know that the best path from i to j that only uses vertices 1 through k is defined by shortestPath(i, j, k), and it is clear that if there were a better path from i to k + 1 to j, then the length of this path would be the concatenation of the shortest path from i to k + 1 (using vertices in {1, ..., k}) and the shortest path from {k + 1} to j (also using vertices in {1, ..., k}).

If w(i, j) is the weight of the edge between vertices i and j, we can define shortestPath(i, j, k + 1) in terms of the following recursive formula: the base case is  

    shortestPath(i, j, 0) = w(i, j)  
and the recursive case is  

    shortestPath(i,j,k+1) = min(shortestPath(i,j,k), shortestPath(i,k+1,k) + shortestPath(k+1,j,k))  
This formula is the heart of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. The algorithm works by first computing shortestPath(i, j, k) for all (i, j) pairs for k = 1, then k = 2, etc. This process continues until k = N, and we have found the shortest path for all (i, j) pairs using any intermediate vertices. Pseudocode for this basic version follows:


```
1 let dist be a |V| × |V| array of minimum distances initialized to ∞ (infinity)
2 for each vertex v
3    dist[v][v] ← 0
4 for each edge (u,v)
5    dist[u][v] ← w(u,v)  // the weight of the edge (u,v)
6 for k from 1 to |V|
7    for i from 1 to |V|
8       for j from 1 to |V|
9          if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] 
10             dist[i][j] ← dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
11         end if
```
