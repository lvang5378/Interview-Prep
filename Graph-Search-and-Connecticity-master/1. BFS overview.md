####BFS
-    explore nodes in "layers"
-    can compute shortest paths
-    connected components of undirected graph

RUN TIME: O(m+n) linear time

####BFSï¼ˆgraph G, start vertex s)      //G can be either directed or un-directed graph
[all nodes initially un-explored]  //don't want to explore a vertex twice  
- mark s as explored
- let Q=queue data structure (FIFO), initilized with s
- while Q != empty:
  - remove the first node of Q, call it v
  - for each edge (v, w):
    - if w un-explored
      - mark w as explored
      - add w to Q ( at the end)
      
#####Claim 1. at the end of BFS, v explored <=> G has a path from s to v  
Reason: special case of the generic algorithm   
#####Claim 2. Running time of main while loop   O(ns + ms) where ns: # of nodes reachable from s. ms:# of edge reachable from s    
Reason: by inspection code

####BFS and SHORTEST PATH
Goal: compute dist(v), the fewest $ of edges on a path from s to v  
Extra Code:   
  - initialize dist(v)= {o if v=s, +infinite if v!=s  
  - when considering edge (v, w)  
    - if w unexplored, then set dist(w)=  dist(v) + 1    
    
#####Claim: at termination, dist(v) = i <=> v in ith layer  
(i.e. <=> shortest s-v path has i edges)  
Proof idea: every layer i node w is added to Q by a layer (i-1) node v via the edge (v, w)  

NOTE******BFS can find shortest path while DFS cannot generally do that

####BFS and Undirected connectivity 
NOTE: *** only for undirected graph****  
Let G(V, E) be an undirected graph  
Connected components = the 'pieces' of G  
Formal definition: equivalence classes of the relation u~v <=> Exis u-v path in G [check: ~ is an equivalence relation]  
Goal: compute all connected components  
Why? 
- check if network is disconneted    
- graph visialization    
- clustering(example if 2 obj's are similar, low edge value, if 2 obj's are not similar, high edge value)

####Commected Components via BFS  
To compute all components: (undirected case)  
- all nodes unexplored [assume labelled 1 to n]  
- for i=1 to n  
  - if i not yet explored     [in some previous BFS]
    - BFS(G, i)  //discovers previsely i's connected component     
    
NOTE: finds every connected comoponent  
RUNNING TIME: O(m+n)    O(1) per node, O(1) per edge in each BFS //not in outer loop
