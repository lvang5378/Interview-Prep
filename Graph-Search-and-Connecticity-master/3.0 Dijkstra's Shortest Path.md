###Single-Source Shortest Path 
    - Directed Graph
    - Non-negative length edge    *** important 

####Pseudo Code  
Initialize:
    - X = {s} [vertices processed so far}
    - A[s] = 0 [computed shortest path distances]
    - B[s] = empty path [computes shortest paths]   //this array only to help explanation!
    
    Main Loop
    - while x!=v:    //need to grow x by one node
    - among all edges (v, w) in E with v in X, w not in X, pick the one that minimizes A[v] + l_vw  
                            //Dijkstra's greedy criterion   [call it (v*, w*)]   
                            //A[v] already computed in ealier iteration
    - add w* to X
    - set A[w*] := A[v*] + l_v*w*
    - set B[w*] := B[v*] U (v*, w*)
    
####Naive implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm 
    O(mn) 
    - (n-1) iterations of while loop 
    - O(m) work per iteration [O(1) work per edge]  
    
###Can we do better?
    Yes, Heap Operations
    - heap: pergorm inser, extract-min in O(logn)
    - conceptually, a perfectly balanced binary tree
    - heap property: at every node, key <= children's keys
    - extract-min by swapping up last leaf, bubbling down 
    - insert via bubbling up
    Also : will need ability to delete from middle of heap [bubble up or down as needed]
    
    
#### Two Invariants  
  1. elements in heap = vertices of V-X   
  2. for  V not in X, key[v] = smallest Dijkstra greedy score of an edge (u, v) in E with u in X   
  (of + infinite if no such edge exists)  
  
      Point: by invariants, extract-min yields correct vertex w* to add to X next  
      (and we set A[w*] to key[w*])
      
To maintain invariant #2: when w extracted from heap (add to X)   
     - for each edge (w, v) in E:
        - if v in V-X (in heap)
          - delete v from heap
          - recompute key[v] = min{key[v], A[w]+l_wv}  //greedy Dijkstra score of (w, v)
          - re-insert v into heap

#### Running time analysis
    Dominated by heap operations O(logn) each 
    - (n-1) extract mins  //once per iteration
    - each edge (v, w) triggers at most one delete/insert combo (if v added to X first)  
  so: # of heap operations is O(m+n) = O(m) //since graph weakly connected
#### so: running time = O(mlogn) ************ //like sorting
