##For Graphs with negative weight edges
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-23-bellman-ford-algorithm/

We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem. Dijksra’s algorithm is a Greedy 
algorithm and time complexity is O(VLogV) (with the use of Fibonacci heap).
Dijkstra doesn’t work for Graphs with negative weight edges, 
Bellman-Ford works for such graphs. Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems. 
But **time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE)**, which is more than Dijkstra.

###Algorithm  
- Input: Graph and a source vertex src  
- Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.

```
1) This step initializes distances from source to all vertices as infinite and distance to source itself as 0. 
Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.

2) Calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph.
    a) Do following for each edge u-v
      If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v]
      dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv

3) This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v
    If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle”
```
The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees shortest distances if graph doesn’t contain negative weight cycle. If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a shorter path for any vertex, then there is a negative weight cycle
