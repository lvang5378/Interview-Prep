##Algorithm
```
1) Input is a connected, weighted and directed graph.
2) Initialize all vertices as individual components (or sets).
3) Initialize MST as empty.
4) While there are more than one components, do following
   for each component.
      a)  Find the closest weight edge that connects this 
          component to any other component.
      b)  Add this closest edge to MST if not already added.  
5) Return MST.
```

A spanning tree means all vertices must be connected. So the two disjoint subsets (discussed above) of vertices must be connected to make a Spanning Tree. And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a Minimum Spanning Tree.
