##In Directed Acyclic Graph, calculate single source shortest distance in **O(V+E)** time using **Topological Sort.**
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-for-directed-acyclic-graphs/  

We initialize distances to all vertices as infinite and distance to source as 0, 
then we find a topological sorting of the graph. Topological Sorting of a graph represents a 
linear ordering of the graph (See below, figure (b) is a linear representation of figure (a) ). 
Once we have topological order (or linear representation), we one by one process all vertices in 
topological order. For every vertex being processed, we update distances of its adjacent using 
distance of current vertex.

####Following figure is taken from this source. It shows step by step process of finding shortest paths.

####Following is complete algorithm for finding shortest distances.
```
1) Initialize dist[] = {INF, INF, â€¦.} and dist[s] = 0 where s is the source vertex.
2) Create a toplogical order of all vertices.
3) Do following for every vertex u in topological order.
    Do following for every adjacent vertex v of u
        if (dist[v] > dist[u] + weight(u, v))
            dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
```

####Code from geekforgeeks
```c++
// The function to find shortest paths from given vertex. It uses recursive 
// topologicalSortUtil() to get topological sorting of given graph.
void Graph::shortestPath(int s)
{
    stack<int> Stack;
    int dist[V];
 
    // Mark all the vertices as not visited
    bool *visited = new bool[V];
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        visited[i] = false;
 
    // Call the recursive helper function to store Topological Sort
    // starting from all vertices one by one
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        if (visited[i] == false)
            topologicalSortUtil(i, visited, Stack);
 
    // Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite and distance
    // to source as 0
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        dist[i] = INF;
    dist[s] = 0;
 
    // Process vertices in topological order
    while (Stack.empty() == false)
    {
        // Get the next vertex from topological order
        int u = Stack.top();
        Stack.pop();
 
        // Update distances of all adjacent vertices
        list<AdjListNode>::iterator i;
        if (dist[u] != INF)
        {
          for (i = adj[u].begin(); i != adj[u].end(); ++i)
             if (dist[i->getV()] > dist[u] + i->getWeight())
                dist[i->getV()] = dist[u] + i->getWeight();
        }
    }
 
    // Print the calculated shortest distances
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        (dist[i] == INF)? cout << "INF ": cout << dist[i] << " ";
}
```
