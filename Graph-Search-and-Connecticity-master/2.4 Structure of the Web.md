###The Web graph
  - vertices = web pages
  - (directed) edges = hyperlinks  
      

#####Question: what does the web graph look like?  (assume you've already "crawled" it)  
    Size: around 200 million nodes, around 1 billion edges (year 2000) pre-map-reduce/Hadoop

####The Bow Tie
    (giant SCC) //"core of the web"
    
    IN ----- (giant SCC) ------ OUT   //bow tie shape
    IN: e.g. new web pages
    OUT: e.g. corporate web sites
    their are hiperlinks go from IN directly to OUT called "tubes"
    
#####Main Findings
    1. all 4 parts (giant, IN, OUT, tubes+trendings) have roughly the same size
    2. within CORE, very well connected (has the "small world" preperty) [Milgram] //6 degree of seperation
    3. outside, suprisingly poorly connected

####Moderm web research
    1. temporal aspectes - how is the web graph evolcing over time?
    2. informational aspectes - how does new information propagate throughout the web (or blogosphere, or twitter. etc)
    3. finer-grained structure -  how to define and computer "communities" in information and social networks?
